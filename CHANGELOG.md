- Allow to draw all points of a Dataset in Graph objects
- Python 3.9 in drone
- Remove numpy from dependencies

## [0.13.0]
### Add
- Doc Typescript
- newHistogram plot to replace current Histogram
    - There is no covering between multiplot histogram and this one so the two of them can live in plot_data at the same time
    - Axes:
        - Handled in a BasePlot object and instantiated specifically in each kind of plot (Frame, Histogram,...)
        - Generate their own ticks, with a start number (default is 7 for normal plot, 20 for xAxis of Histogram)
        - Ticks are built from the nearest 5 multiple in floor(log10(minValue)) with an interval computed with (maxValue - minValue) interval
        - Instantiated in Canvas with CanvasMatrix as fixed objects
        - Mouse style can be activated for debug stuff
    - BasePlot:
        - Base Plot for any plot
        - Manage mouse, features and axes instantiation
        - In BasePlot, all objects are fixed
    - Frame:
        - Classic orthogonal plot with X and Y axis
        - Allow to instantiate moving objects as bars, points, or any other
        - Moving objects are projected in the frame movingMatrix, updated for any mouse translation or wheel
- New Shapes have been created to facilitate the refactor. They will be harmonized with the rest of plot data later:
    - newShape is the base Shape
    - Then some standard shapes (rect, circle, cross, plus, half line,...)
    - newText
    - Bar, to handle Histogram objects
- Histogram can be instantiated in multiplot
    - Rubberbands are not totally connected

### Fix
- Allow to put " " in file paths
- Allow to draw a multiplot with no data
